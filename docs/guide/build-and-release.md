# Build and Release

## Local Builds

Package the app from the repository root:

```bash
npm run build:win
npm run build:mac
npm run build:linux
```

The packaged artifacts are written to `dist/`.

Use the command that matches the artifact you want to build. In local development, the most reliable path is to build Windows artifacts on Windows and macOS artifacts on macOS.

## Tag-Based Releases

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. detects tags matching `v*`
2. syncs the tag version into `package.json`
3. builds Windows, macOS, and Linux artifacts
4. uploads the files to a GitHub Release

Example:

```bash
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

## Regenerate the Release Header

Use the bundled Python helper with `uv run`:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_release_header.py --version 0.2.0 --output assets/release-header.svg
```

## Publish the Docs Site

The `docs.yml` workflow builds the VitePress site from `docs/` and deploys `docs/.vitepress/dist` to GitHub Pages.
